# SAP2000-python-for-structural-optimization
The Computer and Structures inc. (CSi) SAP2000 finite element software is used with Python OAPI for Structural Optimization purposes. The implemented code performs the size optimization of the steel members (beams and columns) of a planar frame under seismic loading retrieved with the dynamic linear modal analysis with elastic response spectrum. The steel frame is supposed to be located in the Abruzzi region, Italy (structural code regulations NTC2018). The genetic algorithm provided by the acknowledged Python library pymoo (https://pymoo.org/) is employed to efficiently address the structural optimization problem. Both SAP2000 sequential computing and parallel computing for structural analyses are provided to efficiently perform the exploration of the optimal structural layout.
